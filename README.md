# Function-Library-XOJO

These are a bunch of classes and functions I used throughout my programming days in High School when coding in REALbasic (proprietary programming language for XOJO). A lot of these functions are sorting algorithms, optimized mathematical algorithms I did for fun, useful functions for game development, etc.

It contains:

  Classes:
    - A fully function Maze generator class
    - A Vector class
  
  Functions:
    - Array to Memory Block functions for using OpenGL with XOJO
    - Sorting algorithms like Bubble Sort, Selection Sort and Merge Sort
    - Array copying for all data types
    - Iterative and recursive factorial algorithms
    - Iterative and recursive fibonacci number generators (BONUS: FibonacciHuge for calculation VERY VERY big fibonacci numbers that don't          even fit in Int64s)
    - String Manipulation
    - Line-Circle and Line-Line intersection calculator
    - Arithmetical factorization 
    - Prime factorization
    - Prime test
    - Greatest Common Factor (PGCD in french because the name of the function is written in french.. I don't remember why)
    - Smallest Common Multiple (PPCM, also in french)
    - A ton of explicit data type conversions
    - First degre and second degree polynomial solutions calculator
    - A few math functions like log and root
